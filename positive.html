            Staying positive can be tough. Positivity can start to wain when you are bombarded with a succession<br>
            of negativity, failures, disappointment and heartbreak. Every challenge you face withdraws from your<br>
            energy, resilience and a little bit of your faith. Once your positive energy is depleted, pessimism<br>
            slowly begins to creep in and take hold. Positive thinking is a mental and emotional state of mind <br>
            that focuses on the good and expects positive outcomes. Developing and maintaining positive energy <br>
            involves more than merely thinking happy thoughts. It is the anticipation of good (i.e. happiness,<br>
            health and success) and it is the belief that all things — situations, obstacles and difficulties <br>
            — will work out favorably in the end. Optimism does not involve ignoring negativity. It is the <br>
            acknowledgement of the negative but then choosing to focus on the positive. At its root, it is simply<br>
            the belief that despite the current circumstances, things will work out favorable in the end.<br>
            <br>
            A positive mind comes from a heart full of faith.<br>
