            Negativity is toxic to your entire system, so clearing negative energy is<br>
             an important strategy on your journey of holistic well-being. Here are six <br>
             ways to remove negative energy from your mind and body.
             <br><br>
             * Make Meditation a Regular Part of Your Life *<br>
             * Practice Pranayama Exercises *<br>
             * Get Out into Nature *<br>
             * Move Your Body *<br>
             * Go Complaint-Free *<br>
             * Smile Often *<br><br>

            One of the Buddha’s foundational teachings is that life contains suffering. You <br>
            could just as easily say that life contains negativity, as it is one of the more<br>
          insidious disguises suffering wears. Acute or chronic, psychological and emotional<br>
           negativity can be a regular experience in your life that creates a dampening field<br>
            on your subtle body.
            <br><br>
           Negativity can make you feel heavy, dark, and gloomy; feel emotionally reactive and <br>
           defensive; and view the world through a mixed filter of fear, anger, and paranoia. Since <br>
           your mind and body are so deeply intertwined, mental and emotional negativity also has a <br>
           physical counterpart: tense muscles, shallow breathing, increased blood pressure, elevated<br>
            levels of adrenalin and cortisol—all the tell-tale signs of the stress response hard at work.
            <br><br>
            Negative energy is a toxin to your system. And while you can often endure negativity in your<br>
             mind and body for prolonged periods (even to the point of it becoming a fundamental trait of <br>
             your personality), negativity ultimately does you no good. Therefore, becoming and staying free <br>
             from negative emotions and energy is an important strategy on your journey of holistic well-being. <br>
             To begin the healing process, you will need to clear negative energy from your system in order to <br>
             allow positive energy to thrive.
            <br><br>
            Before identifying tools of clearing negative energy from your mind and body, it’s important to <br>
            explore the sources of negativity in your life and why you can be so easily trapped by negative influences.

           <strong>Sources of Negativity</strong><br><br>
           Any negative experience begins in consciousness—meaning, that it all starts with an evaluation. Some form of psychological or emotional need is not met and when that happens, the mind perceives the experience as falling short of its preconceived expectations. Therefore, any negative experience is essentially a negative interpretation of what has taken place. In reality, any experience has a neutral meaning; it’s neither good nor bad in any absolute sense. It’s only your subjective and constructed understanding of the event that gives it a positive or negative evaluation.

           Another factor that complicates negative experiences is what’s known as the negativity bias. The negativity bias is the tendency of your nervous system to preferentially look for negative experiences (the bad news) over positive ones (the good news). As counterintuitive as this seems, the negativity bias is the byproduct of millions of years of evolution; it’s a survival mechanism that taught you to favorably look for danger because by doing so you could anticipate a threat and take preemptive steps to fight or flee, thus guaranteeing your survival. Those early hunter-gatherers who weren’t inclined to be on the lookout for danger didn’t live long enough to pass that trait on to us. Unfortunately, the negativity bias is still very much a part of your brain and nervous system, and although life-threatening situations are relatively rare now, you may still look for and cling to the negative, often resulting in a pessimistic, distrustful, and cynical attitude toward life.
           
           Now that you see where negativity arises and why you’re neurologically wired to seek it out, let’s take a look at six pathways for negative energy cleansing from your mind and body.
