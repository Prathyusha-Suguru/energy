            Negativity is toxic to your entire system, so clearing negative energy is<br>
             an important strategy on your journey of holistic well-being. Here are six <br>
             ways to remove negative energy from your mind and body.
             <br><br>
            One of the Buddha’s foundational teachings is that life contains suffering. You <br>
            could just as easily say that life contains negativity, as it is one of the more<br>
          insidious disguises suffering wears. Acute or chronic, psychological and emotional<br>
           negativity can be a regular experience in your life that creates a dampening field<br>
            on your subtle body.
            <br><br>
           Negativity can make you feel heavy, dark, and gloomy; feel emotionally reactive and <br>
           defensive; and view the world through a mixed filter of fear, anger, and paranoia. Since <br>
           your mind and body are so deeply intertwined, mental and emotional negativity also has a <br>
           physical counterpart: tense muscles, shallow breathing, increased blood pressure, elevated<br>
            levels of adrenalin and cortisol—all the tell-tale signs of the stress response hard at work.
            <br><br>
            Negative energy is a toxin to your system. And while you can often endure negativity in your<br>
             mind and body for prolonged periods (even to the point of it becoming a fundamental trait of <br>
             your personality), negativity ultimately does you no good. Therefore, becoming and staying free <br>
             from negative emotions and energy is an important strategy on your journey of holistic well-being. <br>
             To begin the healing process, you will need to clear negative energy from your system in order to <br>
             allow positive energy to thrive.
            <br><br>
            Before identifying tools of clearing negative energy from your mind and body, it’s important to <br>
            explore the sources of negativity in your life and why you can be so easily trapped by negative influences.

           <strong>Sources of Negativity</strong>
            Any negative experience begins in consciousness—meaning, that it all starts with an evaluation. Some <br>
            form of psychological or emotional need is not met and when that happens, the mind perceives the experience <br>
            as falling short of its preconceived expectations. Therefore, any negative experience is essentially a negative<br>
